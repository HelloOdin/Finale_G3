# LBYCPG3_FinalProject
This project was created by Francisco Armintia, Sarrah Dela Cruz, Gabriel Medina and Shan Pleños.

# Overview
As college students, we recognized that many of our peers struggle to find the time and resources to prepare healthy and satisfying meals. We saw an opportunity to create a website that would provide a collection of some of the popular food selections in De La Salle University Laguna Campus.

# Getting Started
NOTE! Before running the project, make sure that "Node.js", "Python", and "VSCode" are installed in your local device. In order to check if you have them installed in your local device, follow these steps:

    For "Node.js":
        1. Open command prompt (or terminal).
        2. Type "node -v" without the "" marks. 
        3. If you have it installed, it will tell you the version of the installed "Node.js". Otherwise, it will display an error.
    
    For "Python":
        1. Open command prompt (or terminal).
        2. Type "Python" or "py" without the "" marks.
        3. If you have it installed, it will tell you the version of the installed "Python". Otherwise, it will display an error.

    For "VSCode":
        1. Open command prompt (or terminal).
        2. Type "code -v" without the "" marks.
        3. If you have it installed, it will tell you the version of the installed "VSCode". Otherwise, it will display an error.

If you have all of them installed, skip these installation steps below. If not, follow these installation steps below:

    For "Node.js":
        1. Open your browser, and navigate to this website: https://nodejs.org/en/download
        2. Choose the "LTS" version
        3. If you are using Windows OS, click "Windows Installer". If you are using Mac OS, click "macOS Installer". This will download the installer.
        4. After the download has finished. Go to your "Downloads" folder, and open the installer file. (ex. node-v18.16.0-x64.msi)
        5. Once it opened, click "Next".
        6. Accept the terms & agreements by ticking the check box that says "I accept the terms in the License Agreement". Then, click "Next".
        7. You may opt to change the installation path, but to prevent errors, just leave it as it is. Then, click "Next".
        8. Click "Next".
        9. Click "Next".
        10. Click "Install". This will ask you if you want to allow this application to make changes to your local device, just press "Yes".
        11. After installing, just click "Finish".
        12. Check if "Node.js" has been successfully installed in your local device by following the verification steps above.

    For "Python":
        1. Open your browser, and navigate to this website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
        2. Dowload the latest version by clicking "Download Python 3.11.3".
        3. After the download has finished. Go to your "Downloads" folder, and open the installer file. (ex. python-3.11.3-amd64.exe)
        4. Once it opened, tick the 2 checkboxes "Install launcher for all users (recommended)" and "Add Python 3.11.3 to PATH".
        5. Click "Install Now". This will ask you if you want to allow this application to make changes to your local device, just press "Yes".
        6. The installation may take a few minutes. Once it is done, just click "Close".
        7. Check if "Python" has been successfully installed in your local device by following the verification steps above.

    For "VSCode":
        1. Open your browser, and navigate to this website: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
        2. If you are using Windows OS, click "Windows". If you are using Mac OS, click "Mac". This will download the installer.
        3. After the download has finished. Go to your "Downloads" folder, and open the installer file. (ex. VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.77.3.exe)
        4. Accept the terms & agreements by ticking the check box that says "I accept the agreement". Then, click "Next >".
        5. You may opt to change the installation path, but to prevent errors, just leave it as it is. Then, click "Next >".
        6. Click "Next >".
        7. Tick 3 checkboxes "Create a desktop icon", "Add 'Open with Code' action to Windows Explorer file context menu", and "Register Code as an editor for supported file types".
        8. Click "Next >".
        9. Click "Install".
        10. Click "Finish".
        11. Check if "VSCode" has been successfully installed in your local device by following the verification steps above.

Once everything is installed, create a folder and unzip the project files inside it.

# Requirements
For this website to work, all of the required packages are already saved in a file. The javascript packages are saved on the package.json file found inside the ui folder while the requirements.txt, which contains the packages for python, will be found on the backend folder of the project folder. To install these packages, go to VS Code, open the project folder which should be Final_Project_CPG2, and then run two terminals.

    For the javascript packages:
        1. Type in one of the terminals: cd ui
        2. After, type npm install package.json
    
    For the python packages:
        1. Type in the other terminal: cd backend
        2. After, type pip install -r requirements.txt

After this, all the required packages are now installed. All that needs to be done is to run the code. For that we need to type the following:
    
    On the ui terminal:
        1. Type: npm start
    
    On the backend terminal:
        2. Type: py manage.py runserver
        3. Note: py keyword might be python or python3 depending on your configuration.
        
# Tested On
